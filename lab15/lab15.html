<h1>Lab 15: AJAX</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with jQuery and AJAX.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Lab 15: AJAX proved itself to be s very different type of lab experience. While at first it seemed to be extremely complex as it was quite different from previous labs, due to the very thorough instructions provided by Professor Wes, as well as a slight hand from ChatGPT, we were able to make our way through this challenging lab. Chatgpt was used to ensure that our code was both A: on the right path and B: clear of any syntactic or logical errors. The ajax recipe provided by professor wes was extremely helpful too as otherwise I don't think we would have had the degree of success that we have now.</p>
