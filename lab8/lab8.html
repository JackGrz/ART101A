		<h1>Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks</h1>
			<p>Working with my partner, we are to experiment with anonymous functions and callbacks.</p>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p>The purpose of this lab is to familiarize ourselves with callbacks and anonymous functions which were discussed on last Thursday's class.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Throughout Lab 8: Anon Functions and Callbacks, we both incountered little to no technical hiccups thanks to the guidance of Professor Wes, however, the subject matter of callbacks and anonymous functions is still something that we are both trying to fully comprehend given our previous academic history which lacks anything like this.</p>
		<h2>Results</h2>
