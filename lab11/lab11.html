		<h1>Lab 11: JavaScript Events and Forms</h1>
		<h2>Challenges</h2>
			<p> The purpose and main goal of Lab 11: JavaScript Events and Forms is to familiarize ourselves with JavaScript events.</p>
		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p>Thanks to the guidance of Professor Wes and the collaborative efforts made between my partner and I, this lab turned out to be relatively straightforward. The previous lab was somewhat more difficult, but that was primarily due to a few errors in earlier code that gave me a few technological hiccups, however, since then I organized my code and now thanks to that this lab was a breeze.</p>
