			<h1>Lab 4: Pseudocoding and Problem Solving</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>Create pseudocode for a javascript based game; in this case, a game of Rock, Paper, Scissors.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> Slight complications arose when trying to figure out what information in our high-level lists would be appropriate or not. That being said, by working as a group we both managed to extract and include only the most neccessary information. </p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>This specific lab made us reconsider organizational styles as well as well as reflect on what information is crucial and a must-have in our code and what can be discarded due to its repetetive and/or irrelevant nature. This assignment served as an important tool when it comes to changing how we perceieve and understand language in javascript. </p>

					<ol>
						<li>Locate your spare tire and jack.</li>
						<li>Remove spare tire, jack, and lug wrench from their storage location.</li>
						<li>Use the lug wrench to remove bolts from tires.</li>
						<li>Ensure that bolts are loosened in the order that represents the shape of the star.</li>
						<li>Place the jack under the vehicle.</li>
						<li>Ensure that it is aligned to one of the four jack points under the vehicle.</li>
						<li>Turn the jack so that it slowly lifts the car.</li>
						<li>Make sure the car is lifted high enough so that the tire can be removed.</li>
						<li>Remove old tires.</li>
						<li>Place the old tire to the side.</li>
						<li>Place the spare tire where the flat tire was located.</li>
						<li>Ensure that the spare tire is aligned properly.</li>
						<li>Tighten bolts on the spare.</li>
						<li>Tighten them enough so that the tire does not fall off when you lower the car.</li>
						<li>Slowly lower the car with the jack.</li>
						<li>Once the car is back on the ground, use the lug wrench to ensure that bolts are tightened on the tire.</li>
