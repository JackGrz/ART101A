                      <p>My name is Jack Grzegorzyk. I am currently a fourth year Politics major at the University of California, Santa Cruz eagerly awaiting graduation and my next chapter of life. My passions include studing politics, cooking and playing retro video games from time to time. I am grateful to be taking Art101a, Programming for the Arts, under the instruction of Wes Modes as I have no prior coding experience and know that I will earn some life-long skills in this course. Currently I am looking to potentially create a website or software that combines the world of wine and the world of programming. What the function of this program is is TOP SECRET, however. Shhhh...</p>

                      <p>Build a working webpage using both HTML and CSS.</p>

                      <h2>Problems</h2>
                      <p>The initial main problem was that both my partner and I lack any experience in coding in HMTL and CSS, however, through partner coding, attending lecture, revisiting lecture an attending our section our understanding as to how to proficiently code up a rudimentary HTML & CSS website was achieved. </p>

                      <h2>Reflection</h2>
                      <p>This lab proved itself to be a great step forward in our web-design journey as not only did it put us through the ringer by anabling us to put all of our current skills to the test, but it also enabled us to be introduced to parter programming. Working together in real life, side by side and after section, served to be a fantastic way to both memorize new ideas and create digital media through the utilization of said ideas. </p>
