					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p> The challene of this lab was to integrate variables and document writeln code in javascript and transfer said code into HTML.</p>

					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p> For the most part this lab was very straightforward, however a slight problem arose when trying to insert our lab 5 JavaScript into our HTML webpage. During my first attempt to link the JS file to my HTML, i found that my JS data didn't transfer. Through rereeading my own code, however, I found that I missed a leading quotation mark that prevented HTML from sourcing the JS file. A simply syntactic error in a short assignment like this is not a big problem, but one can only imaging the headache it could cause a coder who is deep into their work, forcing them to scrounge through their previous lines of code to find a missing quotation mark. </p>

					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p>lab 5 proved itself to be a nice step forward into the realm of JavaScript and the interaction that it can have with both HTML and CSS. Personally, this assignment was relatively easy, in part to the group efforts made between my partner and I, however because of my syntactic slip-up I found myself reflecting on the importance of rereading my own code. Quality-wise, I think my final product covers all required bases in tasks 1-4 to a great degree.</p>
