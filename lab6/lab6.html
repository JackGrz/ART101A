			<h1>Lab 6 - Arrays and Objects</h1>
			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Challenge</h2>
					<p>The challenge and goal of Lab 6 was to familiarize ourselves with arrays and objects in JavaScript first through the integrated Google Chrome developer console and then in Virtual Studio Code.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Problems</h2>
					<p>For myself, not many issues popped up as tasks one and two seemed to be pretty straightforward, serving as a refresher of thursday's introductory lecture on the subject. Task 3 was understandably more challenging, however, my group partner Daniel walked me through how to not encounter any hiccups in the coding process so I really owe it to him for giving me a collaborative walkthrough.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
					<h2>Reflection</h2>
					<p> Overall, Lab 6: Arrays and Objects served itself to be a very useful and integral step forward into coding in JavaScript which focused heavily on organization and formulae which ultimtaly facilitate future coding. I once again have to give it up to my partner Daniel for addressing the issues he had and showing me how to overcome the obstacles that he had. </p>
