		<h2>Challenge</h2>
			<p>The main goal and challenge of Lab 9: Libraries and jQuery was to practice integrating libraries into our javascript code to not only facilitate our coding through modifications, but also enabling us to create more advance and user-engaging sites.</p>

		<h2>Problems</h2>
			<p> For the most part, Lab 9: Libraries and jQuery proved itself to be a rather straightforward lab thanks in part to Professor Wes's guidance as well as the fact that this assignment is a stepping stone into the depths of jQuery and advanced JS. Despite this lab being relatively straightforard, however, I ran into a major road block that I will have to investigate later, but I think it stems from my lab.css file being all sorts of messed up and divided up. While I was still able to make my website and button function, my desired aesthetic changes as a result of a button press were not entirely met, but I guess what mostly counts is the button being functional. I did have to utilize the help of ChatGPT to remove an issue that I had where 2 buttons were present (a common issue with a couple other labs), so I give credit to it in my JS code as it enabled me to only deal with one button. That being said, it is clear that within the chatgpt guided code, I aimed to modify more of my website aesthetics post-button click.</p>
