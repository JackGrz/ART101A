		<h1>Lab 13: Loops</h1>
			<h2>Challenges</h2>
				<p>Working with your partner, experiment with loops.</p>
			<h2>Problems</h2>
				<p>Lab 13: Loops proved itself to be one of the more challenging labs as formatting the JS structure to produce the exact desired results was rather complex and dependent on prior code. That being said, through rereading our slides and rewatching the lectures we were eventually able to brainstorm what went wrong and how best to debug. The evidently led to our success for this rewarding lab.</p>
