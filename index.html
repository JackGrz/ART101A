					<h2>Welcome!</h2>
					<p>Looks like you have found the ONE and ONLY home for all things Jack Grzegorzyk.</p>
					<p>My name is Jack Grzegorzyk. As of 04/11/2024, I am a fourth year politics major at the University of California, Santa Cruz.
						I set up this website not only for my ART101A "Programming for the Arts" course, but to potentially create a home page for a personal project that I have currently in the brainstorming phase.
